# blrevive-server-wine - Acknowledgement

While the base APKBUILD and patch is taken straight from [Alpine's repos](https://git.alpinelinux.org/aports/tree/community/wine/APKBUILD), I was greatly inspired (and lifted plenty of code) from [pg9182/northstar-dedicated](https://github.com/pg9182/northstar-dedicated/)'s zlib/libpng licensed wine packaging.
